# Hi, I’m @Sujan-Naik
I am currently in my 3rd year studying a BSc in Computer Science at Kings College University

## My interests and expertise are in:
  - Full-stack web-development
  - Machine learning
  - Game development
  - Robotics

### I have developed full-stack group projects with the following web development stacks:
  - The *Django Web Framework*, see my [team and task management project](https://github.com/Sujan-Naik/dingo)
  - The *MERN Stack*, see my [interactive Polling project](https://github.com/Sujan-Naik/poll)

### Professional web-development experience
- AI Web3 Internship [Smallcap.ai](https://www.linkedin.com/company/smallcapai/posts/?feedView=all)
  - Working on a Vue.js frontend
  - Integration, using Axios, of the frontend and Flask backend, with a MySQL server
  - Produce logo designs using Canva, and a landing page design with Figma

### See my [robot navigation project](https://github.com/Sujan-Naik/ros-navigator):
  - An interesting example of using state machines with ROS and object detection to create a home robot



### In my spare time I work on an MMORPG project for Minecraft:

- [SereneWorldGen](https://github.com/SereneOasisMC/SereneWorldGen)
> Custom procedural world generation

> This is a complete rewrite of Minecraft's World generation

> Complete with randomly generated Kingdoms, populated with SereneNPCs 

- [SereneNPCs](https://github.com/SereneOasisMC/SereneNPCs)
> NPCs that mimic real players, even by faking player connections

> They can hold basic conversations (atm pre-programmed but I have plans to incorporate generative AI)

> Players can interact with them to open a GUI to trade with and accept quests

> Can do everything a player can do, traverse terrain, kill entities, eat food

> WIP adding reinforcement learning

- [SereneAbilities](https://github.com/SereneOasisMC/SereneAbilities)
> An extremely complex ability system

> Elemental based classes

> Original concept designs created by myself

- [SereneRPG](https://github.com/SereneOasisMC/SereneRPG)
> A traditional RPG style levelling system

> Intricate skills that merge seemlessly with everyday Minecraft gameplay 

> Double jumps, redirectable arrows, wall clinging, beheading, reduced fall damage are just some of them
